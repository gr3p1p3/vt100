#VT100.js

Player for VT100-Animations.
Play & enjoy old school animations on your terminal.

## Intro

VT100-Animations are files containing special [escaped character sequences](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ANSI_escape_code), that old [VT100-Terminals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VT100) recognize and render.

Every modern Terminal can emulate this behaviours, but unfortunately they are too fast for this goal.
